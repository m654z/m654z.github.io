<h1>Chance</h1>
<p>Chance is an esoteric programming language with the goal of being as hard to program in as possible.</p>
<p>Chance, hence its name, is heavily based on chance. Each command has a 1 in 3 percent chance of working, and every working command has a 1 in 2 percent chance of doing what you want it to do.</p>
<p>In fact, the Hello, world program written in Chance has a 0.000043% chance of running.</p>
