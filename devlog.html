<h3><a id="Day_1_2"></a>Day 1</h3>
<p>I created some basic art (grass tile and dirt tile) and also added basic player movement. Here’s a little GIF I made:</p>

<p>As you can see, the falling physics are pretty bad right now. In my opinion, the cube falls a bit too slow… X axis movement is fine though.</p>

<h3>Day 2</h3>
<p>Added some basic jumping. It's super glitchy though, and I'm not sure how to fix it.</p>

<p>I also made the camera follow the player.</p>
<p>(Tilemaps in Unity are <i>so</i> much easier than in Pygame, especially with Tiled and Tiled2Unity, which is what I use to import my Tiled maps.</p>

<h3>Day 3</h3>
<p>Not much progress today. (Didn't have much time) I added an enemy, the snake. It doesn't move and it pretty much just floats off when you push it, but you can still collide with it and you lose health when you do.</p>

<p>That's pretty much it for today.</p>
