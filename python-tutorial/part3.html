<h2 id="part-3">Part 3</h2>

<p>So far, you’ve been writing <em>output-only</em> programs. That means that the programs only display text. They aren’t very interactive.</p>

<p>Well, let’s change that. Let’s get to know a new command, <code>input()</code>. <code>input()</code> asks for, well, input. Let’s make a program that asks for the user’s name is, and says “Hello, (name)!”.</p>

<pre><code>print("What is your name?")
name = input()
print("Hello, " + name)
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, you can assign input to variables. In this case, the user’s input is being assigned to the <code>name</code> variable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Info:</strong> If you don’t want to use <code>print()</code> along with <code>input()</code>, you can also do <code>input("What is your name? ")</code>. This gets input on the same line as the text.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next line of code displays “Hello, ” along with the <code>name</code> variable.</p>

<p>To add two or more strings together, you can do <code>print(text1 + text2)</code>. It’s as simple as that. Of course, if you try adding two integers together, you’ll get the result, but we’re talking about strings.</p>

<hr>

<p>Well, now that you know about displaying text, math, variables and input, let’s combine those and create a simple calculator (more specifically, an adder).</p>

<p>Before you freak out, let me tell you that it’s actually quite simple. Type the following code into a file:</p>

<pre><code>num1 = input("Type the first number: ")
num2 = input("Type the second number: ")
print("The result is " + str(num1 + num2) + ".")
</code></pre>

<p>Hey, why is there a <code>str()</code> command there? Well, you can’t add integers to strings, so you have to convert the integer to a string first. <code>str()</code> does just that.</p>

<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>

<ul>
<li>Make a program that asks what you want to print, and how many times you want to print it. Then print it as many times as specified by the input.</li>
<li>Take the code for the simple calculator, and change it so you can add three numbers together.</li>
</ul>
