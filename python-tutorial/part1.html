<p>You’re ready to learn Python? Great!</p>

<p>But wait, don’t get too excited yet. I’m assuming you don’t have Python on your computer yet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Some Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Installing Python is quite simple. Head over to Python’s homepage at <a href="python.org">python.org</a>. Go over to the Downloads section, and download Python 3.4.4 for your operating system.</p>

<p>Once you have Python installed, go to the Start Menu (or the equivalent for your operating system) and look for a program named something like “IDLE (Python 3.4 GUI)”. Open it up.</p>

<p>You’ll see something like this:</p>

<p><img src="m654z.github.io/img_1.PNG" alt="IDLE" title=""></p>

<p>This is the “Python Shell”, sometimes known as “Interactive Python”. </p>

<p>The Python Shell is great for writing simple programs, as the code is executed (run) right away, but for longer ones you’ll need to create a separate file.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Info:</strong> You can make new files by going to File -&gt; New.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For now, though, we’ll be using the Python Shell.</p>

<p>When you learn a new programming language, the first program you write is a program that says “Hello, world!” Let’s do it in Python!</p>

<p>So, you’ve got the Python Shell open. Type in the following, and press Enter:</p>

<p><code>print("Hello, world!")</code></p>

<p>Did you see what happened? Python spoke to you! To make python “print” things onto the screen, use the <code>print()</code> command.</p>

<p><img src="m654z.github.io/img_2.PNG" alt="Hello, world!" title=""></p>

<p>Feel free to experiment with the <code>print()</code> command some more!</p>

<p>Well, displaying text is good and all… but what if you want to do some math?</p>

<p>Don’t worry, Python is excellent at math. Let’s try a few simple calculations in the Python Shell.</p>

<p><code>2+2</code> should output 4. <br>
<code>8*8</code> should output 64. <br>
<code>14-6</code> should output 8. <br>
<code>32/8</code> should output 4.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> expressions like <code>2+2</code> work fine in Interactive Mode, but while working in a file, you’ll have to use <code>print(2+2)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you might have noticed, some of the operators (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, etc.) are different from the ones you usually use. For example, <code>/</code>. Unfortunately, there’s nothing you can do about it, so you’ll just have to get in the habit of using the new operators.</p>

<hr>

<p>Well, that concludes Part 1, but before you move on to the next part, you’ll want to do these simple exercises.</p>

<ul>
<li>Experiment with the <code>print()</code> command. Try doing <code>print("text" * 10)</code> and see what happens!</li>
<li>Try calculating something useful with Python!</li>
<li>Write a simple program that combines the <code>print()</code> command and math.</li>
</ul>
