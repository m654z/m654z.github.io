<h2 id="part-2">Part 2</h2>

<p>I hope you’ve done the exercises from the previous part. If you haven’t, you should go and do them now, because, y’know, practice makes perfect.</p>

<p>Last part was pretty simple, but now we’re going to learn about something more advanced.</p>

<p><code>print()</code> is great for printing text, but what if you want to display some text two times in the code?</p>

<p>If you thought “Well, use <code>print("text" * 2)</code>, duh” then congratulations! You’re right.</p>

<p>But what if you want to display the same text two times <em>in different places</em>? You’ll probably want to use variables.</p>

<p>Variables are, simply explained, pieces of data assigned to a name. For example, you could have a variable named “book” that is assigned to the text “The Lord of the Rings”.</p>

<p>In Python, you would do this:</p>

<p><code>book = "The Lord of the Rings"</code></p>

<p>Now, if you want to display <code>book</code>’s data, you could do <code>print(book)</code>. Hey, no quotes! Well, when printing variables, you don’t need quotes.</p>

<p>You can even do this with variables:</p>

<pre><code>a = 10
b = 20
print(a + b)
</code></pre>

<p>What do you think this outputs? It outputs 30, because you are adding the variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> together, which are assigned to <code>10</code> and <code>20</code>.</p>

<p>You might have noticed that <code>book = "The Lord of the Rings"</code> has quotes, but <code>a = 10</code> doesn’t.</p>

<p>Well, that’s because <code>The Lord of the Rings</code> is a <em>string</em>.</p>

<p>Strings are, simply, text. Let’s say that a string is something that you can’t add to an <em>integer</em> (which is a number).</p>

<p>So, strings need quotes, but integers don’t.</p>
